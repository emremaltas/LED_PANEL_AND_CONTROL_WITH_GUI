# LED_PANEL_AND_CONTROL_WITH_GUI

In this project, a selected image is saved to an SD card using a Qt interface. The STM32 microcontroller reads this image and displays it on a WS2812 Neopixel LED-based panel. The system was developed using **C, C++, and OpenCV**. Images are processed with OpenCV to fit the LED matrix.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **STM32F4 Series Microcontroller**  
- **Qt Framework** (GUI Development)  
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)  
- **WS2812 Neopixel LEDs**  
- **SD Card Data Reading**

### 💡 Project Features
- Image selection, preview, transition timing adjustment, and writing to SD card via Qt GUI  
- STM32 reads the image data from the SD card and sends it to the LEDs  
- Display of colorful images on Neopixel LEDs  
- Embedded system application developed in C/C++
